I told myself to start blogging once I reached 100 days streak on GitHub. And yesterday I reached that goal. 

[The proof.](http://github.com/erming)

These past months has been a really good experience for me. Once I get my blog fully up and running I'll write a blog post about it. 

My next goal is 150 days and on my way to reach that goal I'll keep this blog updated with the things I work on, the problems I face and their solutions, tips and tricks etc..

Stay tuned.
