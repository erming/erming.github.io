### Usage

To create a timestamp in bash, use the `date` command:

```bash
date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" # 2014-01-01 00:00
```

_Surround the format in quotes when it contains a space._

### Strings

You can also use it directly inside strings:

```bash
echo "time is `date +%T`" # time is 00:00:00
```

### Formats
